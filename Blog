# Title:Building a Weather App with JavaScript: Exploring API Integration and DOM Manipulation

## Introduction:
In this blog post, we will discuss the process of building a weather app using JavaScript. We will dive into key concepts such as API integration and DOM manipulation to create a functional weather website.

## Setting up the HTML Structure:
To start, we need to set up the basic HTML structure of our weather app. We define a div that holds the header, search input field, and a weather-cards div to display the weather information. We also link the necessary CSS stylesheets to ensure a visually pleasing interface.

## Event Listeners and User Interaction:
To allow user interaction, we utilize JavaScript event listeners. We add an event listener to the search button and the search box. When the user clicks the search button or presses the Enter key, the searchWeather() function is triggered.

## Fetching Weather Data from an API:
To retrieve weather information, we add an API key. We use the fetch() function. We construct the API URL by combining the base URL with the user's search input and an API key. The API responds with weather data in JSON format.

## Handling API Responses:
Once we receive the response from the API, we parse the JSON data using the response.json() method. We then check the response code to determine if the data is valid. If the code responds with an error, we display an error message using the showError() function. Otherwise, we proceed to display the weather information using the showWeather() function.

## Displaying Weather Information:
In the showWeather() function, we create DOM elements to represent the weather information. We create a weather card div and populate it with the city name, temperature, and humidity. The temperature value is converted from Kelvin to Celsius by subtracting 273.15. Finally, we append the weather card to the weather-cards div for display.

# Conclusion:
By combining API integration and DOM manipulation techniques, we have successfully built a weather website using JavaScript. This website allows users to search for weather information based on a city name and presents the data in a visually appealing manner. With further enhancements and additional features, this weather app can be expanded to provide even more comprehensive weather forecasts and functionalities.
